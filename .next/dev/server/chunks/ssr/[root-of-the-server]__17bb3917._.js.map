At some organizations, BDRs are senior to SDRs. At others, it's reversed. Some companies only have one role and call it either name.\r\n\r\n**What actually matters:**\r\n- Inbound vs. outbound focus\r\n- SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise targets\r\n- Quota structure and OTE\r\n- Path to AE promotion\r\n\r\n## Compensation Comparison\r\n\r\nEntry-level roles in both tracks typically offer:\r\n- **Base:** $45,000 - $65,000\r\n- **OTE:** $65,000 - $90,000\r\n- **Top performers:** $100,000+\r\n\r\nOutbound-focused roles often have slightly higher OTEs due to difficulty, but inbound roles may have higher attainment rates.\r\n\r\n## Which Should You Target?\r\n\r\n**Choose inbound (SDR) if:**\r\n- You're brand new to sales\r\n- You want to learn qualification before prospecting\r\n- You prefer a more predictable workflow\r\n\r\n**Choose outbound (BDR) if:**\r\n- You're comfortable with rejection\r\n- You want to develop prospecting skills fast\r\n- You're targeting enterprise companies (more outbound-heavy)\r\n\r\nThe best approach: apply to both and let the interviews reveal which fits your style.\r\n    `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    slug: \"tech-sales-no-experience\",\r\n    title: \"Breaking Into Tech Sales With Zero Experience\",\r\n    summary: \"The exact playbook for career changers to land their first SDR role without a sales background.\",\r\n    category: \"Breaking In\",\r\n    readTime: \"10 min read\",\r\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-28\",\r\n    content: `\r\nEvery day, people with zero sales experience land SDR roles at top SaaS companies. Teachers, bartenders, military veterans, retail workers—the path is open to anyone willing to learn the playbook.\r\n\r\n## Why Tech Sales Is Accessible\r\n\r\nUnlike investment banking or consulting, there's no target school list. Companies care about three things:\r\n\r\n1. **Coachability** - Can you take feedback and improve?\r\n2. **Grit** - Will you push through rejection?\r\n3. **Hustle** - Do you have the energy for high-volume work?\r\n\r\nYour background matters less than demonstrating these traits.\r\n\r\n## The Preparation Checklist\r\n\r\n**Before you apply:**\r\n- Learn basic SaaS metrics (ARR, MRR, churn, CAC, LTV)\r\n- Understand the SDR role deeply (daily activities, metrics, tools)\r\n- Research 10-15 target companies\r\n- Prepare your \"why sales\" story\r\n- Practice cold call role-plays\r\n\r\n**Your unfair advantage:**\r\nWhatever you did before taught you something relevant. Teaching? You can explain complex concepts simply. Hospitality? You handle difficult people with grace. Retail? You've already sold face-to-face.\r\n\r\n## The Application Strategy\r\n\r\n1. **Optimize LinkedIn** - Headline: \"Aspiring SDR | [Current Role] → Tech Sales\"\r\n2. **Target the right companies** - High-growth startups with SDR training programs\r\n3. **Apply directly AND network** - LinkedIn messages to SDR managers\r\n4. **Show, don't tell** - Send a prospecting email to the hiring manager as your application\r\n\r\n## The Interview Process\r\n\r\nExpect 3-5 rounds:\r\n- Recruiter screen\r\n- Hiring manager interview\r\n- Role-play or mock cold call\r\n- Team culture interview\r\n- Final round with sales leadership\r\n\r\nThe mock cold call is where most candidates fail. Practice until it's natural.\r\n\r\n## Your First 90 Days\r\n\r\nThe hard work doesn't stop at the offer. Your first quarter determines your trajectory. Arrive early, stay late, ask questions, and hit your ramp targets.\r\n\r\nThe best SDRs treat their first role like grad school—except you're getting paid to learn.\r\n    `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    slug: \"saas-sales-metrics\",\r\n    title: \"SaaS Sales Metrics Every Rep Should Know\",\r\n    summary: \"The essential metrics that drive tech sales—and how to speak fluently about them in interviews.\",\r\n    category: \"Technical\",\r\n    readTime: \"8 min read\",\r\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-25\",\r\n    content: `\r\nUnderstanding SaaS metrics separates prepared candidates from everyone else. These are the numbers that drive every conversation in tech sales.\r\n\r\n## Revenue Metrics\r\n\r\n**ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)** - The yearly value of subscriptions. A company with 100 customers paying $10K/year has $1M ARR.\r\n\r\n**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)** - ARR divided by 12. Used for more granular tracking.\r\n\r\n**ACV (Annual Contract Value)** - The average ARR per customer. Higher ACV typically means longer sales cycles and fewer deals needed.\r\n\r\n## Customer Metrics\r\n\r\n**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** - Total sales and marketing spend divided by new customers acquired. Companies obsess over this number.\r\n\r\n**LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Total revenue expected from a customer over their lifetime. Healthy SaaS companies have LTV:CAC ratios of 3:1 or higher.\r\n\r\n**Churn Rate** - Percentage of customers who cancel. For SaaS, under 5% annual churn is good; under 2% is excellent.\r\n\r\n## Sales Metrics\r\n\r\n**Quota** - Your sales target, typically measured in ARR or number of meetings booked.\r\n\r\n**Quota Attainment** - Percentage of reps hitting quota. Ask this in interviews—it reveals a lot.\r\n\r\n**Sales Cycle Length** - Time from first touch to closed deal. SMB: 14-30 days. Mid-market: 30-90 days. Enterprise: 90-365 days.\r\n\r\n**Win Rate** - Percentage of opportunities that close. Varies widely by segment and company.\r\n\r\n## Why This Matters\r\n\r\nWhen an interviewer asks \"Why sales?\" and you respond with fluent knowledge of these metrics, you demonstrate genuine interest and preparation.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask \"What's the average quota attainment on the team?\" you show business acumen.\r\n\r\nLearn these cold. They're the language of tech sales.\r\n    `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    slug: \"cold-call-framework\",\r\n    title: \"The 5-Step Cold Call Framework\",\r\n    summary: \"A repeatable structure for cold calls that consistently books meetings.\",\r\n    category: \"Tactical\",\r\n    readTime: \"7 min read\",\r\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-20\",\r\n    content: `\r\nCold calling isn't dead—it's just done poorly by most reps. Here's a framework that works.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: The Pattern Interrupt (0-7 seconds)\r\n\r\nSkip the \"How are you today?\" opener. Instead:\r\n\r\n\"Hey [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. We haven't spoken before—do you have 30 seconds for me to tell you why I'm calling, and you can decide if we should keep talking?\"\r\n\r\nThis is honest, respectful of their time, and different from every other sales call they receive.\r\n\r\n## Step 2: The Reason (8-20 seconds)\r\n\r\nDeliver your value prop in one sentence tied to their world:\r\n\r\n\"I'm reaching out because we help [their role] at [their company type] solve [specific problem]. Companies like [relevant reference] have seen [specific result].\"\r\n\r\nNo fluff. No \"I'd love to learn more about your business.\" Get to the point.\r\n\r\n## Step 3: The Question (20-35 seconds)\r\n\r\nEarn the right to a conversation:\r\n\r\n\"I'm curious—is [problem] something you're dealing with, or am I off base?\"\r\n\r\nLet them respond. If they engage, you've got a conversation. If they push back, move to objection handling.\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Objection Handling\r\n\r\nThe most common objections:\r\n- \"I'm busy\" → \"Totally understand. Would [specific future time] work better?\"\r\n- \"Not interested\" → \"Fair enough—mind if I ask what you're currently using for [problem]?\"\r\n- \"We already have a solution\" → \"Got it. How's that working for you?\"\r\n\r\nDon't argue. Acknowledge, pivot, and probe.\r\n\r\n## Step 5: The Close\r\n\r\nIf they're engaged:\r\n\r\n\"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like a 15-minute call to show you how we've helped [similar company] with [their problem] could be valuable.

Most candidates stumble because they've never practiced. Here's how to prepare.\r\n\r\n## What Interviewers Assess\r\n\r\n1. **Confidence** - Do you sound like someone a prospect would trust?\r\n2. **Structure** - Do you have a clear call framework?\r\n3. **Adaptability** - Can you handle objections smoothly?\r\n4. **Coachability** - Do you incorporate feedback in real-time?\r\n5. **Energy** - Would you want to receive this call?\r\n\r\n## The Standard Scenario\r\n\r\nYou'll typically be given:\r\n- A fictitious company and product\r\n- A target persona (VP Sales, Head of Marketing, etc.)\r\n- 5-10 minutes to prepare\r\n- 3-5 minutes to execute the call\r\n\r\nSometimes they'll tell you the product in advance. Sometimes you're selling their actual product.\r\n\r\n## Preparation Strategy\r\n\r\n**Before the interview:**\r\n- Practice 20+ mock calls with friends or family\r\n- Record yourself and listen back\r\n- Develop a flexible framework you can adapt to any product\r\n- Prepare 3-5 objection responses\r\n\r\n**During prep time:**\r\n- Identify the core value prop\r\n- Draft a one-sentence pitch\r\n- Anticipate the top 3 objections\r\n- Plan your opening and close\r\n\r\n## The Framework to Use\r\n\r\n1. **Opener:** Permission-based pattern interrupt\r\n2. **Pitch:** One sentence value prop + social proof\r\n3. **Question:** Engage them in conversation\r\n4. **Handle:** Address their objection\r\n5. **Close:** Ask for the specific meeting\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n- Talking too much without pausing\r\n- Sounding robotic or scripted\r\n- Crumbling at the first objection\r\n- Forgetting to actually ask for a meeting\r\n- Getting defensive when pushed\r\n\r\n## The Secret Weapon\r\n\r\nAfter the role-play, they'll ask how you think it went. Be honest: \"I think my opener was strong, but I could have probed deeper on their objection about timing. If I did it again, I'd ask what specifically is driving that timeline.\"\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates self-awareness and coachability—exactly what they're looking for.\r\n    `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    slug: \"ote-negotiation\",\r\n    title: \"Negotiating Your Tech Sales Offer: OTE, Base, and Equity\",\r\n    summary: \"When and how to negotiate compensation for SDR, AE, and leadership roles.\",\r\n    category: \"Career Strategy\",\r\n    readTime: \"7 min read\",\r\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-05\",\r\n    content: `\r\nTech sales compensation has more levers than most candidates realize. Understanding them gives you negotiating power.\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Components\r\n\r\n**Base Salary:** Guaranteed pay regardless of performance.\r\n\r\n**Variable/Commission:** Performance-based pay tied to quota attainment.\r\n\r\n**OTE (On-Target Earnings):** Base + Variable assuming 100% quota attainment.\r\n\r\n**Accelerators:** Higher commission rates for performance above quota.\r\n\r\n**Equity:** Stock options or RSUs, more common at startups.\r\n\r\n## The Base-to-Variable Split\r\n\r\nTypical splits by role:\r\n- **SDR:** 70/30 or 60/40 (Base/Variable)\r\n- **AE (SMB):** 50/50\r\n- **AE (Enterprise):** 50/50 or 60/40\r\n- **Sales Leadership:** 60/40 or 70/30\r\n\r\nHigher base = more stability. Higher variable = more upside.\r\n\r\n## When to Negotiate\r\n\r\n**SDR roles:** Limited room. Most companies have standardized comp bands. Focus on start date or title if anything.\r\n\r\n**AE roles:** More flexibility, especially on base salary and signing bonus.\r\n\r\n**Leadership roles:** Everything is negotiable—base, OTE, equity, accelerators, guaranteed first-year earnings.\r\n\r\n## How to Negotiate\r\n\r\n1. **Wait for the offer.** Never negotiate before they've committed.\r\n\r\n2. **Express enthusiasm first.** \"I'm really excited about this opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n3. **Ask, don't demand.** \"Is there flexibility on the base salary?\"\r\n\r\n4. **Use competing offers strategically.** Only mention if you actually have them.\r\n\r\n5. **Focus on base.** It's easier to adjust than OTE restructuring.\r\n\r\n## The Quota Question\r\n\r\nAlways ask: \"What was quota attainment for the team last year?\"\r\n\r\nThis tells you the real OTE. A $150K OTE means nothing if only 40% of reps hit quota.\r\n\r\n## What Not to Do\r\n\r\n- Don't negotiate the initial SDR offer aggressively (you haven't proven yourself)\r\n- Don't use cost of living as your only argument\r\n- Don't threaten to walk unless you mean it\r\n- Don't forget about non-comp benefits (PTO, flexibility, development budget)\r\n\r\nThe best negotiation leverage: being the candidate they can't lose.\r\n    `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    slug: \"saas-companies-to-target\",\r\n    title: \"Best SaaS Companies for Your First Tech Sales Role\",\r\n    summary: \"How to identify companies with strong SDR training programs and promotion paths.\",\r\n    category: \"Breaking In\",\r\n    readTime: \"5 min read\",\r\n    publishedAt: \"2024-10-28\",\r\n    content: `\r\nNot all SDR roles are created equal.
